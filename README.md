# react-native-practise

This is a sample app created to learn react-native from scratch.
THis sample contains the initial index.android.js file which renders Login page.

It contains a login screen. Have tried to add different styles.
Clicking on sign in will take you to the next page and has basic navigation stuff in it as well.

Should you have any questions regarding the sample, can contact me on hiten.bahri@gmail.com
